# What is Doomsday Algorithm ?
This was inspited by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2x3SSBVGJU) which explains the [Doomsday Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule), which is an algorithm of determination of the day of the week(**DotW**) for a given day.

This method requires trivial memorization (of 'Memorable dates') & simple arithmetic to detemine the DotW.

# What does this repo do ?
This repo does not teach you how to how to determine the DotW, the video & wiki page do an excellect job for that.

The repo has a standalone page which can be used to practice your mastery. The [HTML5 version](index.html) allow
Alternately, you can use the UNIX Shell script to practice the same.

Note that for now, both of them are configured to test you for dates between 1-Jan-2025 & 1-Jan-2027. These can be extended by updating the respective code.
